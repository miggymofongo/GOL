wepa! My name is miguel and this is my game of life simulation! It's a small Javascript file that 
console.logs a grid with custom dimensions to the terminal.  i utilize the readline Node module to 
create an interface that takes an input of dimensions in the following format; 20x20, to initialize
a grid with those dimensions.
check back frequently to see how it evolves over time!
